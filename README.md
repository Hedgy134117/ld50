Delay the inevitable

# Idea
multitasking game, where boxes with small individual tasks pop up
- tasks have timers, whenever one of them runs out, the game is over
- more boxes over time, delaying the inevitable "timer"
  
tasks:
- math equations
- copy text
- press buttons in ascending / descending order
- clicker
- find an element in a list
