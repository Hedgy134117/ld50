  <h1>TASK CHAMPION</h1>

  <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>
  <p>the goal of the game is to complete as many tasks as possible, delaying the inevitability of the timer running out
  </p>
  <p>there are four different types of tasks</p>
  <h3>CLICKER TASK</h3>
  <img src="./clicker-task.png" alt="">
  <p>arguably the easiest task, all you need to do is click the button the amount of times required.</p>
  <h3>ORDER TASK</h3>
  <img src="./order-task.png" alt="">
  <p>click the buttons in ascending order. if you click the wrong one, this task will penalize you by adding 1 second to
    the timer.</p>
  <h3>MATH TASK</h3>
  <img src="./math-task.png" alt="">
  <p>answer the math question by clicking the correct button. if you click the wrong one, this task will penalize you by
    adding 1 second to the timer.</p>
  <h3>TEXT TASK</h3>
  <img src="./text-task.png" alt="">
  <p>arguably the hardest task, all you need to do is copy the sentence into the text box.</p>

  <h2>SCORING</h2>
  <p>for every task the is on the screen, and for every 1/10th of a second that passes, your score goes up by one</p>
  <p>for example, there's 3 tasks on screen, in one second you get 3 * 10 = 30 points</p>
  <p>you get an additional 100 points every time you complete a task</p>

  <p>that's about all there is too it. good luck out there, and become the next TASK CHAMPION!</p>
